	for {MACHINE} say ddmmyy only if it is different day of message or on the border (>22:00 or <02:00). and give ddmm
	for watcher - remember prev message. if now *=0, -=to same dir then send nothing
	correct say in {MACHINE} msg (now it say first msg of sequence not last one) --- NO IT SAY FROM WHICH IT STORE, FROM WHICH IT DEL. MAYBE GIVE RANGE?
	add direction (</>) to {MACHINE}	- get from getById() if marked is deleted
	do not remove messages with video on enforced remove
	looks like 'restore' restore more than expected ( say 10minutes, but it restore whole row)
	--SEPARATE_CHAT=month|day|year save messages

	WHY lastdel_time,stoptime could be int?
	simplify output (vk:...) and command (vk_*)

DONE:
	* FAIL TO RESOLVE NAME VK_VIDEO
	  Private videos required access_key which is changed from session to session. So we can't get from vk_api and than download with full auth.
	  WORKAROUND: write exact source from which it comes (user, chat, wall) and try to parse it as m.vk.com
	  KNOWN BUGS:	1) cookies required to get wall are hardcoded so this could be failed in futher
			2) When copy url from address bar of browser it contains unusable (because dif session) access_key and no info about exact source.
			   We try to find, although not sure

	* WALL_BACKUP - if any comments were removed - leave "copy"
			   - messages/indexes got from latest cache

DONE:
	Refactoring (move out config, vk_utils)
	Token backup
	# add backup of db -- why doesn't help and unsafe clean try happens?
	+message: squeeze: '  '->' '
	#BETTER HANDLE EXCEPTION: WE SHOULD READ CONFIG IN MOST CASES (TO ENSURE THAT --MACHINE /--WAIT_AFTER)
	Significantly boost msg download for multiple reposts/forwards (lazy batch preload of all involved users/groups)
	vk_api logging
	# if unsafe cleaning - make 'keep' action instead

	Refactoring (moving out profiles to vk_utils)
	Boost up to 10 times for updating of wall with comments/likes because of vk_utils.BatchExecutor()  + vk_utils.CachedVKAPI()
			>>> http://qttroll.blogspot.com/2013/10/vkscript.html
	Add tsv_utils.DBG (logging class)
	Do not exit if say 'No' on question 'Download Video?' (some other queued tasks could be present)

	mark as readed incoming messages which are deleted but unreaded --- THIS AUTO HAPPENS WHEN SEND OUTGOING

	--DIR-PREFIX, --NOT_KEEP_IF_MINE
